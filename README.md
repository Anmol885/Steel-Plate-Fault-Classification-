# Steel-Plate-Fault-Classification-
This project develops a machine learning-based system to classify and detect defects in steel plates, such as cracks, scratches, and dents, which impact quality. By automating fault detection, it enhances quality control, reduces production costs, and improves customer satisfaction in industrial manufacturing processes.
