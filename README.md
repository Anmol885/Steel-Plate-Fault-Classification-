# Steel Plate Fault Classification

## Project Description
This project aims to design and implement a machine learning-based system to classify and detect faults in steel plates used in industrial manufacturing processes. Steel plates often suffer from defects such as cracks, scratches, dents, and uneven surfaces during production, affecting their quality and performance. An automated fault classification system can significantly improve quality control, reduce production costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
- Develop an accurate and reliable system to detect and classify faults in steel plates.
- Leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze data from itmages or sensors.
- Optimize the solution for real-time or near-real-time fault detection.
- Provide insights to enhance the manufacturing process.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: High-resolution images or sensor data of steel plates.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques like noise removal, normalization, and augmentation to improve data quality.
- **Fault Categories**:
  - Cracks
  - Scratches
  - Corrosion
  - Dents
  - Edge faults
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Scalable deployment for real-time monitoring in production lines.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB, or R.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- **Hardware**: High-resolution cameras or sensors for data collection.
